# Pushing the limits of heat conduction in covalent organic frameworks through high-throughput screening of their thermal conductivity

This repository contains all 10,750 COF structures in CIF file format that were utilized for deriving structure-property relationships with thermal conductivity in COFs. Additionally, it includes structures demonstrating both high and low thermal conductivity.
